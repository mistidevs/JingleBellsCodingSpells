# Film Coding Spells
## Concept
For this challenge I decided to spread Christmas cheer by creating a website that uses audio to distort the movie picture. Moreover, my selection of music and images strove to encompass as many movie genres and cultures as posssible. The genres encompass thriller, action, family, drama, alien and comedy. If you enjoyed Money Heist then Christmas Heist will give you a run for you money.
